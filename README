Noisemusick App 
www.fluxama.com

This is the code for the Noisemusick iPhone/iPad app available at www.fluxama.com. The license info is in the Noisemusick-LICENSE.txt file, but it is basically just a standard BSD open source license; feel free to reuse and remix code as you wish (just look at the license). 

This app was created by Elliot Clapp, Shawn Greenlee, and Shawn Wallace over the course of 9 months of Tuesday evenings from 2011-2012.

Dependencies:

1. libpd: This is the portable version of Pure Data created by Peter Brinkmann and available here:

  http://www.libpd.cc

Follow the instructions there and put the distibution in the directory pd-for-ios right next to the Xcode project.

2. Cocos2D 2.0: We used the excellent Cocos2d game engine for sprites and whatnot. This project actually has a complete Cocos2d install in the libs directory so you don't need to do anything else. Requires 2.0 for the shader support.

Feel free to email fluxama@gmail.com with any questions or problems.
